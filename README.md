# Bitwise operation library

This is Scala bitwise operation library.

To be easier to describe bitwise operation code like hardware simulator.

## Target

- hardware simulation

## How to install

Easy way to install is

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Soya-Onishi/Bitwise.git 
$ cd Bitwise
$ sbt publishLocal
```

I have yet to create environment to write only `libraryDependency`.

## How to use

After install this library, add following statement in build.sbt.

```
libraryDependencies += "org.me" %% "bitwise-calculation" % "0.1"
```
